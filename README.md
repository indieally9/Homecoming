# Homecoming Project
We made a 2 page website featuring the schedule of CCHS's Homecoming week. In the firstpage we made a table plus 2 image with a button to go to the second page. In the second page there is a button to the home page along with pictures about the hallways. The biggest struggle was trying to get the buttons to work. We ended up making a href button.
